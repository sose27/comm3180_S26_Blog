Guess I am just cursed (just kidding)!\n\n\nBut how do we know this?\n\nThe steps taken via code are not all that different from what we would’ve done with a dataset by hand! The steps are actually rather simple:\n\nFirst, we filter for the February 27 dates in the ‘day’ column of the dataset\nThen, we access the ‘rain’ column to see if it rained or not. How do we know? If the listed number is &gt; 0, it rained!\nNext, we count down the ‘rain’ column for the days with &gt; 0.0 rain\nFinally, we concur: 6 recorded days of rain on February 27th in the last 21 years!"
