With a dataset this large, any strong relationship between agreeableness and neuroticism should be easier to detect.\nHowever, the results were similar to what I saw in our class. Even at scale, the correlation between agreeableness and neuroticism was weak. Many people who scored high in agreeableness still reported relatively high levels of neuroticism.\nThis suggests that being more agreeable does not consistently correspond to being less emotionally reactive or anxious.\n\nsample = big5_scored_df[[\"A\", \"N\"]].dropna().sample(2500, random_state=42)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.scatter(sample[\"A\"], sample[\"N\"], alpha=0.3)\nplt.xlabel(\"Agreeableness\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Neuroticism\")\nplt.title(\"OpenPsych Data: Agreeableness vs Neuroticism\")\nplt.show()\n\nfull_corr = big5_scored_df[\"A\"].corr(big5_scored_df[\"N\"])\nfull_corr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.float64(0.18144744927195994)\n\n\n\nEven with a much larger sample size, the relationship between agreeableness and neuroticism remains weak. High agreeableness does not consistently predict low neuroticism.\n\n\nThis challenges the assumption that being more cooperative or empathetic automatically translates into emotional stability."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nBased on my own results, our class data, and a much larger dataset, there is little evidence that high agreeableness leads to low neuroticism. While agreeableness is often seen as a positive or socially desirable trait, it does not appear to offer consistent protection against emotional instability.\n\n\nThis analysis challenged an assumption I didn’t realize I had, and it was a reminder that personality traits describe tendencies rather than outcomes. Even traits that seem intuitively connected do not always behave that way in real data."
